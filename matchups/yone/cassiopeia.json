  "strategy": "This matchup depends on how good the Cass is. Do your best to dodge her Q poke. You can never Q3 into her or she will just ult you. Her W prevents you from Q3'ing, E'ing, and returning to your E. Use your E to dodge her Q if needed. She is very susceptible to ganks, so try to freeze the wave at your tower and call for jungle help. Only go on her if she misses her Q trying to harass you. Max range ulting is better than Q3'ing because she can't react to it unless she flashes.",

    "If you are poisoned, beware of the potential damage Cassiopeia inflicts with Fatal Bite.",
    "Turn your back to Cassiopeia when she casts Medusa's Gaze, to be slowed rather than stunned."
