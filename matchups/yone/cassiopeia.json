  "strat": "This matchup depends on how good the Cass is. Do your best to dodge her Q poke. You can never Q3 into her or she will just ult you. Her W prevents you from Q3'ing, E'ing, and returning to your E. Use your E to dodge her Q if needed. She is very susceptible to ganks, so try to freeze the wave at your tower and call for jungle help. Only go on her if she misses her Q trying to harass you. Max range ulting is better than Q3'ing because she can't react to it unless she flashes.",
  "tips": [
    "If you are poisoned, beware of the potential damage Cassiopeia inflicts with Fatal Bite.",
    "Turn your back to Cassiopeia when she casts Medusa's Gaze, to be slowed rather than stunned."
