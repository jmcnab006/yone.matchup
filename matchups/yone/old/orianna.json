  "strategy": "Probably the most even matchup for Yone. Her poke is very annoying early, but she's very immobile. Don't let her auto or poke you for free and this lane is a lot easier for you. She's decently tanky because of her E passive when her ball is on her. Look for a trade or an all-in when her ball is not on her or when she uses Q and/or W. You start winning at zerks and vamp scepter.",
