Never trade without your E because if he stays on you he will probably kill you, but even then, Lethal Tempo is just so broken right now that it probably doesn't even matter. Your E can cancel his ult with proper timing. Don't fight him when his W shield is active. Wait for it to go away, then look to re-engage.",
