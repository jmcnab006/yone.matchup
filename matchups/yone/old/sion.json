Later on in the lane, it's more annoying because of how tanky he gets, but his abilities are so telegraphed; he should never kill you. Respect bushes and don't let him fully charge Q on you. You can break his W before it charges to block its damage. You can perma all-in with E; the true damage from the mark will help with trades.",
