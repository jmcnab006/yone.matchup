  "strategy": "This matchup is one of the more annoying mage matchups. She will Q you whenever you go for cs. When you E, she will just E you in return. To counter this, try to be more erratic with your movement to dodge it. You can only all-in or trade with her if she misses her E. Early mantle is good so she can't 100 to 0 you when she hits level 6. Play to scale and set up ganks with your jungler because she's very immobile.",

    "Quickly grab boots when playing against Syndra, they will help you avoid many of her spells.",

    "At max rank, Syndra's spells gain bonus effects and change appearance."
