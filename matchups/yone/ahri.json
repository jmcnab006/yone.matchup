At level 6, it's harder to kill her because she's so mobile. Bait out her charm and then look for short trades or an all-in if you can. Never ult into her if she has her ult up, or she will just ult away and live.",

    "Ahri's survival skills are considerably reduced when her ultimate skill, Spiritual assault, is not available.",
    "Ahri is all about her charm. Stand behind minions or predict the way she’ll throw it so she can’t hit you with a big combo.",
    "Be sure to ward often. Ahri likes to roam quite a bit, and if your team doesn’t see it coming it can be devastating.",
    "Try and Q into her and E at an angle to dodge her charm."
