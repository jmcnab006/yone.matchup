  "strategy": "This matchup is pretty easy for Yone. Gwen is also a scaling champ so the lane isn't too difficult. Yone is very mobile, so you can easily dodge her empowered Q and kite out of her Ult safely. Keep in mind your R and Q3 will not hit her if you are outside of her W. Respect her level 1 as she is incredibly strong with the new Lethal Tempo.",
