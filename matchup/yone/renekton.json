  "strategy": "This matchup is impossible to win 1v1 just because his kit counters yours. Early tabis is a must. The only window you have to beat him early is at level 1 and level 2; he is incredibly weak at this point. After that, you can't trade with him unless he misplays. Be extra careful if he goes Prowler's because he will 100 to 0 you even through tabis. At level 6, you still can't fight him, so just do your best to not die on repeat.",
