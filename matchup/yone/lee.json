You HAVE to dodge his Es becaue they do so much damage (high base damage. Be careful once he's level 6 because his Ult is point click damage. You can rush cloth armor if their jungler and/or mid laner are ad as well. Just look to farm and scale. It's hard to kill him because he can just W away or ward hop away.",
