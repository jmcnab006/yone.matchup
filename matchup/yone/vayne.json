You can't really trade with her until Shieldbow, but even then her mobility is obnoxious. Don't ever let her proc her W on you. She is very squishy, so once you get on her, you should be able to kill her. If you E or Q3 her, she will just E you away. Don't ever go near a wall or she will E you into the wall and you will probably die.",
