  "strategy": "This champion is still very strong even after all the nerfs. She will probably take TP/Ignite. Do not stand next to walls or she will just all-in you. Stay out of her AA range when her Q2 is active. Use your W in response to her W. As long as you keep up in items/gold, you should be able to 1v1 her. Whoever hits their mythic first will take over the lane. Your E can also stop her R if you time it right. Use your E to dodge her E.",
  "tips": [
    "Camille's shield only works against one damage type at a time, so attack her when she's vulnerable to your damage.",
    "Hextech Ultimatum cast range is very short. So try to Flash to get away before Camille gets close enough."
