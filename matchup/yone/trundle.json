  "strategy": "Don't try to fight him level 1. His Q steals your AD, and if he takes Lethal Tempo, you will not win it. I feel like you can just perma jump on him with E until 6. After he has his Ult, do NOT try to fight him bc he will steal your armor/mr so just do your best to kite out of it + his pillar. You can beat him in the side lane later on if you are fed enough. If they have a lot of healing in their comp, executioner's / mortal reminder is extremely valuable.",
