  "strategy": "Tank Cho'Gath is a lot easier than AP Cho'Gath. He is very susceptible to ganks, so try to freeze the wave at your tower and call for jungle help. Always keep moving when he silences you to dodge his Q. Use your W when he Ws you. Dodge his E poke as well. If you ever see him ult, you can win the all-in. If he has ult, do not try to all-in him.",
