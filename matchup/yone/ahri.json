At level 6, it's harder to kill her because she's so mobile. Bait out her charm and then look for short trades or an all-in if you can. Never ult into her if she has her ult up, or she will just ult away and live.",

    "Be sure to ward often. Ahri likes to roam quite a bit, and if your team doesn’t see it coming it can be devastating.",
    "Try and Q into her and E at an angle to dodge her charm."
