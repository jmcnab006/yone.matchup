  "strategy": "This matchup is pretty even. Save your E to dodge his E. Early null-magic mantle is good, similar to the Annie matchup so he can never 100 to 0 you. Save your W for when he Qs into you to block a big part of his burst trade. He can animation cancel his Ult with his Q, so be aware of that. Use your E to dodge his shark as well.",

    "Fizz's attacks become deadly for seconds after his empowered attack. Keep him at bay when his trident shines!",
    "Fizz is elusive when his skills are not on cooldown. Push him to use them quickly, then follow up with crowd control or heavy attacks!"
