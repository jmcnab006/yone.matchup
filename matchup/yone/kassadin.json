  "strategy": "This matchup seems pretty easy, but a good Kassadin can make this lane exhausting. He does a lot more damage than most people expect, especially when he takes electrocute. Your Q spam will help him use his E more, so be aware of that. Do your best to space properly so he can't AA, W, Q you. At level 6, he is a lot stronger. Look to all-in him when he uses his Ult.",
  "tips": [
    "Kassadin primarily deals magic damage. In case of difficulty, buy items that improve magic resistance, such as Mercury's Sandals or Banshee's Veil.",
    "When Kassadin casts consecutive Fissures, he uses more and more mana. Think about it when you chase him.",
    "It only takes 6 spell casts for Kassadin to be able to use Pulse. If he improves this skill, beware when using spells near him."
